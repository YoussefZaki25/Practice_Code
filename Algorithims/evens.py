#For this code I just want you to write a for loop that prints 10 even numbers.
#As a hint, try to think about what an even number is versus an odd number

#Coding is heavily related to math so when thinking of what an even number is
#look for the mathematical definition and try to apply that here

# Code goes here below

for i in range(1,10):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(i)



for i in range (1,11):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)


#In a 5 iteration loop heres what the output should look like
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
