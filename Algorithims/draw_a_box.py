#I wrote this one during my 3rd week and I won't lie this one is a little tough

#Youve learned how to print things.  Now the last challenge Ill leave you here
#for a bit until you complete these is to draw a box with code

# Code goes below here


print(" XXXX\n X  X\n XXXX")
#this was actually the easiest i think u didn't mean it this way but it did the job




#Heres what the output should look like in the terminal

# XXXX
# X  X
# XXXX

#Keep in mind they dont have to be 'X' you can use an '*' asterisk
#as long as it draws a box
