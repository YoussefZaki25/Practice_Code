#Algorithms

In this folder we will practice algorithms.  Essentially, I will set up some
problems for you.  I will describe what I want your code to do, and then we will
see if you can do them.  If not, I'll be able to help you along, but we do want
you to try first.  You dont need any extra knowledge here as long as you already
know variables, lists, for loops, if conditionals, and function declarations.

The goal is to complete the challenge by developing a function that uses for loops
or while loops to accomplish the given challenge

When I first started, many people in my class asked why these matter and how we
can apply them to getting jobs.

We can talk about this later in a call but essentially algorithms come into
everything pretty heavily.

Using the right algorithm you can search through indexes exponentially faster,
solve a problem someone may have not solved before, hash text to make it secure,
crack passwords and so much more.

These algorithms will give you the basis thought process for attacking other
problems later on.
