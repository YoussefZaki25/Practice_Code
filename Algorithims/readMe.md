#Algorithms

In this folder we will practice algorithms.  Essentially, I will set up some
problems for you.  I will describe what I want your code to do, and then we will
see if you can do them.  If not, I'll be able to help you along, but we do want
you to try first.  You dont need any extra knowledge here as long as you already
know variables, lists, for loops, if conditionals, and function declarations.
