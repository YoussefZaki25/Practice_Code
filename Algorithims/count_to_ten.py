#Your first challenge is to write a function that prints every number
#up to ten in the terminal.

# Your code goes below here

for x in range(0,10):
    print(x)

#So you almost have the right idea here.  Let me show you a little example of how I want you to complete these challenges

#First declare the function by what its supposed to be
def count_to_ten():
    
    #Next write a for loop or a while loop to execute the function.
    #You can use range since its a function python gives you but there are other functions 
    #you will want to use a for loop instead.

    #Using range this is what the function would look like
    for number in range(1,11):
        print(number)











# The output should look something like this
#1
#2
#3
#4
#5
#6
#7
#8
#9
#10
